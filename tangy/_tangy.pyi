The method to connect to these buffers is also         shown. This method of creating new buffers and connecting to existing         ones allows the user to hold on to and continously read timetags from         a device in one process and then connect to that buffer in another to         perform analysis on the current data.

def buffer_list_update() -> dict:
    '''
    Up-to-date list of available buffers

    Gets the list of available buffers from the Tangy configuration directory,
        for example, ```~/.config/Tangy/buffers``` on linux and
        ```C:\\Users\\user_name\\AppData\\Local\\PeterBarrow\\Tangy\\buffers```
        on Windows. For each buffer configuration file the existence of the
        associated buffer is checked, buffers that no longer exists have their
        corresponding configuration file removed. Upon completion this returns
        a dictionary containing the buffer name, buffer format and path to the
        configuration file.

    Returns:
        (dict): Dictionary of
            ```{"name": {"format": fmt, "path": "/path/to/config"}```
